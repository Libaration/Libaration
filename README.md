<h1 align='center'> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
<p align='center'> I'm Cristian Deleon a Web Developer, Designer & Creator</p>
<p align='center'> I started coding in middle school using Visual Basic 6. I was mostly creating hex/memory editors and packet loggers for online games in C# and VB6. I've made the switch to Web Development and couldn't be happier. I love Front End design and working closely with customer facing UI. I graduated from Flatiron bootcamp where I really got to put everything together and dive into the full stack! I've worked extensively with Rails on backends for it's simplicity and opinionated code, and React/Redux for it's reusability on the frontend, I'm a passionate coder and pride myself in learning new concepts quickly!</p>
